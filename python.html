            <h1><u>COURSE OUTLINE</u></h1>
            <h3>Python is an interpreted object oriented language used for web development, machine learning, data analysis and robotting. It is also a popular programming language which was created by Guido Van Rossum and released in 1991. </h3>
            <h2><u>USES OF PYTHON</u></h2>
            <p><li>Python is used for Web Development</li></p>
            <p><li>Software Development</li></p>
            <p><li>Mathematics and System Scripting</li></p>
            <h2><u>WHY PYTHON</u></h2>
            <p><li>Python works on different platforms(Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi. e.t.c).</li></p>
            <p><li>It has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li></p>
            <p><li>It has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li></p>
            <p><li>It runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. Prototyping can be very quick.</li></p>
            <p><li>It can be treated in a procedural way, an object oriented way, or a functional way.(The most recent major version of python is python 3, although python 2 is still quite popular)</li></p>
            <h2><u>PYTHON SYNTAX COMPARED TO OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</u></h2>
            <P><li>Python was designed for readability and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics</li></P>
            <p><li>It uses new lines to complete a command as opposed to other programming languages which often uses semicolons or parentheses</li></p>
            <p><li>It relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loop, functions and classes.</li></p>
